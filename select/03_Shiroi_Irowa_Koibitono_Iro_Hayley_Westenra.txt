White is the colour of sweet true love
Oh, the colour of our love
White is the colour of petals that fell
Oh, the sweet lily smell

He was my love, my first true love
A boy from the same land that raised me
White lilies at his feet
White is the colour of sweet true love
Oh, the colour of our love

Blue is the colour of first love
Oh, the colour of our love
Blue as the sky on a clear summer's day
On the meadows we lay

He was my love, my first true love
A boy from the same land that raised me
White lilies at his feet
White is the colour of sweet true love
Oh, the colour of our love

He was my love, my first true love
A boy from the same land that raised me
White lilies at his feet
White is the colour of sweet true love
Oh, the colour of our love

Red is the colour of memories
Oh, the colour of the seas
Glowing in red from the sky above
When you gave back my love

He was my love, my first true love
A boy from the same land that raised me
White lilies at his feet
White is the colour of sweet true love
Oh, the colour of our love
Oh, the colour of our love
Oh, the colour of our love
